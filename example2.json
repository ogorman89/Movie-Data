    "reviewBody": "I couldn&apos;t believe &quot;The Dark knight&quot; could live up to the hype. That&apos;s perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we&apos;ll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale&apos;s Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",
